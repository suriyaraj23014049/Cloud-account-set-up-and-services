Creating private, logically separated networks within the AWS cloud to enhance security and control access between different applications and components.
Subnetting:
Dividing a VPC into smaller subnets for better network organization and security management.
Load Balancing (ELB):
Distributing incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances for high availability and scalability.
PrivateLink:
Establishing private connections between AWS services and on-premises infrastructure without exposing data to the public internet.
Direct Connect:
Creating dedicated private network connections between your on-premises data center and AWS for high-bandwidth data transfer.
